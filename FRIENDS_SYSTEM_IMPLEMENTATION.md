# Friends System Implementation

## ✅ Complete Friends System

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive friends system with connect functionality and a dedicated Friends tab in the community page.

## 🗄️ Database Structure

### **Tables Created**

### **Key Features**

- ✅ Fetch friends list
- ✅ Send friend requests with custom messages
- ✅ Accept/reject incoming requests
- ✅ Cancel sent requests
- ✅ Remove friends
- ✅ Check friendship status
- ✅ Real-time data management

### **2. ConnectButton Component (`src/components/ConnectButton.tsx`)**
- ✅ Smart button that shows different states:
  - **Connect** - Send friend request
  - **Friends** - Already connected
  - **Pending Sent** - Request sent, can cancel
  - **Pending Received** - Accept/reject options
- ✅ Message input for personalized requests

3. Friend request is sent to **User B**
4. **User B** sees request in Friends tab
5. **User B** can Accept or Reject
6. If accepted, both users become friends automatically
